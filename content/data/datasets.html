<h1>Purpose</h1>
<p>This page provides download links, codebooks and data management files (where available) for a variety of data sets commonly used across courses I teach. There are two general categories of data sets, those that have been cleaned to an extent for analysis purposes, and those that are in their original state of disarray.</p>
</div>
<div id="cleaned-data-sets" class="section level1">
<h1>Cleaned data sets</h1>
<p>For use with courses: MATH315, MATH615, MATH 199- R Bootcamp. The code to read the data set into R is provided, along with a glimpse of the data and it’s dimensions. <strong>You must change the path to the data file to your specific path on your computer!</strong> Use this information to confirm that the data set you download and import into R matches this information.</p>
