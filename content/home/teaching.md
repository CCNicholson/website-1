I teach the following courses at Chico State. 

- MATH 105: Introduction to Statistics (Summer 18)
- MATH 130: [Introduction to R](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH130/) (Spr 18)
- MATH 315: [Applied Statistical Methods I](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH315/) (Spr 18)
- MATH 385: Introduction to Data Science (Roualdes, Fall 18)
- MATH 456: [Applied Statistical Methods II](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH456/) (Spr 18)
- MATH 485: [Advanced Data Science](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/ADS/) (Spr 18)
- MATH 615: [Statistical Methods for Graduate Research](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH615/) (Fall 18)

_Most Statistics and Data Science classes at Chico State rotate through instructors or different sections are taught by different instructors. The materials presented on the individual class websites linked above are accurate for my sections only. Terms in parenthesis indicate when the content was last updated._

I use DataCamp quite often to teach or reinforce coding concepts outside of the classroom. They provide very generous educational discounts to help learners with R, Python, SQL, Shell and more topics in Statistics and Data Science.

### [Data](data/)
Wherever possible I try to use real world, non pre-processed data in the classroom. The [Data](data/) page provides links to download data, codebooks where available, and code to import these data sets into R. 


### [Notes](lec/)
A selection of lecture notes that are appropriate for multiple classes.
