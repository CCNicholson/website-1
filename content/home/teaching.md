- MATH 315: [Applied Statistical Methods I](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH315/)
- MATH 385: Introduction to Data Science
- MATH 456: Applied Statistical Methods II
- MATH 485: Advanced Data Science
- MATH 615: [Statistical Methods for Graduate Research](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH615/)

### [Data](data/)
Wherever possible I try to use real world, non pre-processed data in the classroom. The [Data](data/) page provides links to download data, codebooks where available, and code to import these data sets into R.
